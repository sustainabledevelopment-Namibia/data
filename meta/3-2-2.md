  Probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the
  first 28 completed days of life if subject to age-specific mortality rates of
  that period, expressed per 1000 live births. Neonatal deaths (deaths among
  live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into
  early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late
  neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day
  of life.
