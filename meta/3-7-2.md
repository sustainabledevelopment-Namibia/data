  Age specific Fertility rate of woman aged 15-19 years per 1000 women in that
  age group. (Numerators for the ASFRs are calculated by identifying live births
  that occurred in the period 1 to 36 months preceding the survey (determined
  from the date of the interview and the date of birth of the child); they are
  then classified by the age of the mother (in five-year groups) at the time of
  the child�s birth. The denominators for these rates are the number of
  woman-years lived by the survey respondents in each of the five-year age
  groups during the specified period. )
